My Own Cat Tool coding challenge
After doing the [Programming Languages, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) course and solving multiple problems using the Standard ML programming language, I thought that it would be good if I did a project using the Standard ML programming language. So I did the challenge of [Build Your Own cat Tool](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-cat/) using it.

You will need the [Moscow ML](https://mosml.org/) implementation to compile the Standard ML code and the Go programming language to run tests.
